	<h1>Meet the Sybilla Masters Team</h1>
	<p class = "over">The Sybilla Masters Fund was founded by two industry veterans in January 2018.  As two successful trailblazers, we saw the value in investing in women and promoting gender equality in this male dominated Venture Capital Funding landscape. We already knew from our experiences that gender diversity is CRITICAL to entrepreneurial success. We created The Sybilla Masters Fund to focus on collaborating and investing in gender diverse start-ups, with at least one woman in a position of strategic and operational control, which we deem a more risk-intelligent approach to venture capital.  </p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="toggle-inner">
				<p>Numerous studies confirm that companies with diversity in the senior management team prove stronger and more sustainable in the market. First Round Capital’s Ten-Year Study reported that women led companies returned an average of 63% higher ROI to their portfolio. An increasing number of studies reports increased gross margins, reduced customer churn, improved corporate governance, less fraud and other legal entanglements, all of which results in improved investor returns in both private and public sectors. </p>

				<span class="title-name">Why buck the traditional Venture Capital model? </span>
				</h3>
			</div>
			
			<div class="toggle-inner">
				<p>The traditional Venture focuses on funding the software that will power the ‘next big thing.’ Today, the lion’s share of Venture Capital is being invested in IoT, blockchain, Augmented and Virtual Reality, and Artificial Intelligence. The process entails a large number of investments with the expectation that one or two successful exits will return outsized returns, covering the losses for twenty to forty or more unprofitable or inadequately profitable liquidity events. 80% - 90% of venture funding in the United States still goes to male, Caucasian founders, most of whom have attended Harvard or Stanford. 
 </br>
With such a strong focus on such a small sub-group of founders and technologies, we believe that sector is over-invested and is prone to inflated valuations. The deal sourcing, investment premise, and funding process remain largely unchanged in venture capital for 25+ years. 
 </br>
The Sybilla Masters Fund addresses these critical issues. In addition to funding potential ‘Unicorns’ in the technology sector, we invest in companies that demonstrate the ability to provide investors with shorter term 2 – 7x exits. We utilize equity, debt, revenue-sharing, and hybrid model investment instruments designed to meet the more complex business building opportunities and return higher ROI to our investors.

				<p>Our intentional deal sourcing, stringent due diligence process, relevant funding vehicles, and strict tracking and reporting requirements increase success for both investors and founders. 
				<ul>
					<li>We optimize investor returns by seeking high quality deal flow in underinvested sectors and teams. </li>
					<li>We structure investments for optimal value to both investors and entrepreneurs, providing short term smaller exits that power longer term ‘big win’ exits. </li>
					<li>We partner with later stage VCs during our due diligence process and keep interested VCs informed at every benchmark. This establishes strong paths to Series B funding for our portfolio companies that require it. </li>
