	<p class = "over">The Sybilla Masters Fund was founded by two industry veterans in January 2018.  As two successful trailblazers, we saw the value in investing in women and promoting gender equality in this male dominated Venture Capital Funding landscape. We already knew from our experiences that gender diversity is CRITICAL to entrepreneurial success. We created The Sybilla Masters Fund to focus on collaborating and investing in gender diverse start-ups, with at least one woman in a position of strategic and operational control, which we deem a more risk-intelligent approach to venture capital.  </p>

			<h3 style = "color: white;"> Sybilla Masters: The Story Behind Our Name </h3>
        </div>
    </section>
	
	<div class = "history" style = "padding-bottom: 5%;">
	<p> In 1812, Sybilla Masters sailed with the permission of her husband from Philadelphia harbor to London to pursue a patent for her invention, a
method of curing and processing corn into what would become known as grits. The patent process took three years, during which Sybilla
opened a millinery shop, where she invented a process for creating straw hats from palmetto leaves and cornered the market. In 1715, King
George I of England awarded the first to a person residing in America to Thomas Masters to her husband, Thomas Masters, as women were
prevented by law from holding patents. At Thomas’ insistence, the king had the patent read, “...for a new invention found out by Sybilla, his
wife.” So did the second patent for Palmetto-leaf straw hats. And Sybilla made her husband a very wealthy man.</p>
	</br>
	<p>It takes both men and women to set things right and both genders benefit when everyone is equally supported and rewarded in their efforts to
build new and better products and processes. But for Thomas, Sybilla Masters, like so many women, would have been lost to history. For far
too long, women and people of many diverse backgrounds have been intentionally excluded from the activities of invention, business, and the
ownership and rewards of their own work. The Sybilla Masters Fund is chartered to source, fund, and champion diverse founding teams with
at least one woman in a position of strategic and operational control. </p>
	</br>
	<p> Today, women continue to be badly hampered in scaling their businesses by a severe lack of capital. Merely 2.19% of all venture capital money
was awarded to women in 2017. In 2018, the number slipped to 2%. We aim to change that by launching a $100MM fund chartered to fund
capable female founders building high potential, scalable corporations.</p>

		<p>That makes funding of all-male founders from these schools a very crowded space. 
The most valuable deals are often funded in &#39;closed door&#39; private deals between colleagues at existing VC firms, which means other investors rarely gain
access to &#39;A&#39; grade deals. At the same time, &#39;A&#39; grade deals are being overlooked in underserved locations, founding teams, and market sectors, providing an
opportunity for higher ROI.</p>

		<h1>Let's Reduce the Risk for Next Round Funding</h1>
		<p>Angels and seed investors put capital into companies without knowing who will fund those companies at the next level and when. To reduce the risk of these early stage investments, we continue to establish and enhance relationships with later stage VCs. There will be companies that VC's want to fund but that are too early for them which they will send to us with a list specific benchmarks which need to be reached before they are ready to fund, as well as for companies we are considering. For each investment, we look for four to six VC's to express interest in each portfolio company to reduce the risk that the company will be unable to raise a next round.

			<h1 style = "text-align: left;">Global Deal Flow</h1>
			<p style = "text-align: left;">The most foolish reason to invest in a company is its address. Everyone laughs when we say this, but far too many investments are made from a very small ‘gene pool’ of companies within a small geographic area. Limiting deal flow to specific zip codes limits our opportunity to find the most valuable companies for the portfolio. By making connections with like-minded venture firms around the world, we share deal flow, due diligence, and syndicate funding with experts on the ground anywhere a brilliant company with high ROI prospects is found. </p>

		<h1 style = "text-align: left;">Better Ways to Get Our Money in and Out</h1>
		<p style = "text-align: left;">Traditional venture capital does a very good job of funding the software that powers the ‘next big thing.’ Venture Capitalists invest in companies that appear to be able to become the next unicorn. This space is overvalued and overinvested. Exits take an average of 11 – 16 years. Most investors can play that game twice in a lifetime. A common complaint of early stage investors is that their capital is tied up for more than a decade with no exit in sight. Even successful exits often return about the same ROI as a REIT. That’s insufficient for the risk of this asset class.</p>

		<h1>Bet on Product Launches, not Companies </h1>
		<p>With a debt instrument based on a revenue-share agreement, we can invest in companies that do not intend to sell or go public. Typical revenue-share investments return 2x – 4x in 3-5 years. Our risk is limited to the ability of the company to make sufficient sale such that our investment is repaid at a reasonable multiple from an agreed upon percentage of gross sales revenue. We are not betting on the long-term capability of a team to scale the company; neither must we wait for the company to have a liquidity event – sale or IPO, fro example -- to re-deploy our capital. </p>
